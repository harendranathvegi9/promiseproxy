# PromiseProxy
A yet another library for promisifying callback-style APIs, but this time implemented using the ES2015 [`Proxy`][1] object. It works by defining the API structure and creating a `Proxy` that intercepts method calls and returns a `Promise` if a callback parameter is omitted. The benefit of using a `Proxy` is that the API is extended without the need to duplicate it or monkey patch its methods. The `Proxy` is implemented in less than 20 lines, making this approach very lightweight and easy to audit.
